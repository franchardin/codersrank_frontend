    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Hi, my name is Francisco. <quote>Â¿How are you doing?</quote>(yep, Joey Tribbianni quote).</h2>
    <p>I'm a musician and teacher who's learning web development. I'm a very curious person and I've allways liked tech and social activities. In my coding learning path (started in 2015) I've come across with lots of great teachers, most of them students as well, who were kind and generous enough to spend their time to help others grow and learn.
    </p>
    <p>In music and coding I was sometimes struggling to understand or to archive something. In those moments when I wanted to throw away my guitar or my keyboard (the computer's or music one) I've found that someone else had been there before. When I saw them grabbing their hair or smashing their heads in the desk I knew I wasnt alone. Frustration is a bad thing to deal with, but sometimes the road to "success" is made from "faliures". 
    </p>
    <p>That's why I want to use my time learning code to share some of my little experience and (with some luck) it can be helpful to others.</p>
